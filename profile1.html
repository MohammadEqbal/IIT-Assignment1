      <h1> Interest in IT </h1>
    </div>
    <div class="sectionContent">
        <p> My uncle had an ISP in Afghanistan and he is a successful person with a great career. When I was in 11th grade I suggested my uncle far a part time job in his company and he accepted. At first I thought IT would be very simple and it is just networking but when I entered in, I found IT as a challengeable, hard, abstruse, multipart with a good salary. Being challengeable of IT because I become more interest in because when a question come to my mind and when I found the answer it, this is very interesting to me and I want to know the related points about it.
For the first time my brother offered me RMIT for the first time. Before I didn’t know about RMIT. After offering RMIT form my brother to me, I searched about it and I found RMIT a university with international standards, a rich library and well equipped laboratory, best online system, excellent website and best teachers and one of the best university in Australia that graduated great students which are now the best masters and scientists.
I expect three things from this course. 1: As the name implies (Information to Information Technology), I expect that the world of technology introduces by instructors in depth for us, 2: familiarity with RIMT’s online system and canvas for the next subjects, 3: I really want to be a network professional by help of RMIT instructors.</p>

  <h1> Personal Profile </h1>
    <h3> First test </h3>
  </div>
  <div class="sectionContent">
      <p>As the result of an online Mayers-Briggs test, my personality is (Defender). As the result I feel a deep sense of responsibility to around. I can be counted on to meet deadlines, remember special days like somebody’s birthday, uphold traditions and shower my loved ones with gestures of care and support. But I rarely demand recognition for all I do, preferring instead to operate behind the scenes.
Among Defender’s (me), 1: Most distinctive trait is loyalty and rare I allow a friendship or relationship to fade away from lack of effort instead, I invest a great deal energy into maintaining strong connection with my loved ones, as the result I am a loyal person. 2: “good enough” is rarely good enough. I take my responsibility personally, consistently going above and beyond and doing everything that I can to exceed other’s expectation. 3: Although I am introverted, but I have a deeply social nature. I have a special talent for making my friends and acquaintance feel seen, known and cherished. 4:Romantic Relationship, romantic relationship bring out a site of my personality type that may not be obvious at first glance. Beneath my mild, unassuming exteriors, I thrum with passionate commitment and loyalty toward the people I love. At times, I myself surprised by the intensity of my feelings, especially my fierce desire to protect and care for my partner. 4: Friendship, given how warm, supportive and generous I am, it is not surprising that others gravitate toward me as friend. I tend to be private and a bit protective of myself, and it can take me a while to feel comfortable enough to open up to someone new. 5: Parenthood, caring and steadfast, I take the responsibilities of parenthood seriously. But when it comes to parenthood, I don’t motivate by sense of duty, I am also motivated by love, and the depth and power of this love can be nothing short of amazing. 6: Career path, I am often the backbone of my workplace: reliable, hardworking and always ready to lend and hand. 7: Workplace habit, wherever I may be on the career ladder, I share the goal of putting good service and dedication above all else. </p>

  <p> What you have read so far is just an introduction into the complexities of the caring, devoted and incredibly loyal Defender personality type that online Mayers-Briggs test attributed to me.</p>

<div class="sectionTitle">
  <h3> Second test </h3>
</div>
<div class="sectionContent">
    <p>As result of an online learning style test, I am tactile learner and I learn by touching and doing. I remember and understand things through physical movement. I am a “hands-on” learner who prefer to touch, move, build, or draw what I learn, and I tend to learn better when some type of physical activity is involved. I need to be active and take frequent breaks, I often speak with my hands and gesture, and may have difficulty sitting still. As a tactile learner, I like to take things
      apart and put things together, and i tend to find reasons to tinker or move around when I become bored. I may be very well coordinated and have good athletic ability. I can easily remember things that were done but may have difficulty remembering what I saw or heard in the process. I often communicate by touching, and I appreciate physically expressed forms of encouragement, such as a pat on the back.</p>
</div>
<dic class="sectionTitle">
  <h3> Third test </h3>
</div>
<dive class="sectionContent">
  <p> An online health test shows the bellow result for my body:</p>
  <p> Well, it could be better...but then again, it could be worse. Although your well-being isn't as high on the priority list as it should be, you still seem to pay attention to several major aspects of your health and put in some effort to improve or maintain them. Nevertheless, your lifestyle and health-related behavior could use some minor changes. You can start by working on the aspects of your lifestyle to which you did not answer "Often" and "Most of the time" or "Mostly true" and "Completely true" on the test. You'll certainly discover the pay off in your energy levels, resilience to illness and increased sense of wellbeing. It's worth it! After you make the changes, come back and take the test again - and celebrate your new and improved lifestyle.</p>
</div>
<dic class="sectionTitle">
    <h3> Questions </h3>
  </div>
  <div class="sectionContent">
      <p>What do the result of these tests mean for you? after answering to website’s question, the robot diagnosis me that I have (Defender) personality whereas after reading the description I surprised from it. Because all of the characteristics which explained here, matched to my character. Before, I felt my behavior and abilities but not completely. Now I know my character with detail and I will try to keep my habits. So, in my opinion the course wants us to we find our main personality by this test.</p>
      <p> How do you think these results influence your behavior in a team? I think it can help us a lot. I want to give example our course group, after uploading this to GitHub, everybody can read and know our personality type and when my group member knows what kind of person I am, he/she behave me as my personality. </p>

      <h1> Project Idea </h1>
        <h3> Overview </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="newC">
        <p> The project that I considered for this course is called Problem Solver. I have an idea that if I could make this by help of you guys, it will help a lot in IT industry. Problem Solver is a chip like a flash. The work that it does is to take the full information of the device and find the exact problem of the device. by making this technology the IT managers, technicians and all the IT staff can save most of their valuable and important time. I hope that you perception and love my idea and by help of each other could make it.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="newST">
        <h3> Motivation </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="newC">
        <p> When I was as an IT technician in an ISP I faced a lot with problems on network devices and I was force that from any way I should troubleshoot it. Maybe not only me but also most of IT employees hate facing problem and troubleshooting, because of this I had this idea from 2 years ago. If Problem Solver create and invent by us, this cause the problem of the device solve very fast than troubleshooting it by hand of human. Problem solver can find the exact problem in less than 1 minute but if it belongs to hands of us, we should search internal and external pieces of a device which waste out time a lot.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="newST">
        <h3> Description </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="newC">
        <p> Problem Solver is a chip with a display page that are connect to each other wirelessly.  The chip is configured with whole commands, instructions, multiple solutions for the time that device have problem and need a troubleshooting and an active sensor which diagnosis the statues of internal device’s piece that see whether the internal pieces are active or not. The function of Problem Solver is like this that when you plug it into your device, the first task is to insure the health of internal pieces of the device and show the health of the internal piece on the display screen which is connect to it wirelessly. for example, in a  Cisco device like Cisco Switch, the chip first scans the whole device (switch)  whether all pieces are active or not active, for this we can say the first step of troubleshooting if the device’s status is active, an automatic massage come to Display page and we would be sure that the problem is not from physical device and if a pieces of device like device’s processor is broken or fired an automatic massage will come to display page that the device’s processor is inactive and it needs to change ( any massage that the programmer wrote on it’s program). If the device be 100% in health the second step is that Problem Solver send a packet to CLI or GUI of the device (where the configurations are run in a device) and for hard disk of device and wants all the configuration and instructions which the IT manager commanded or wrote for device and the device act  or follow from them, after receiving, as the Problem Solver know  all the commands, instructions, multiple solution, can see where is the main problem that the configuration have (in here we can command the Problem Solver two ways,1: itself solve the problem immediately, 2: send an auto massage to display page and  explain the main problem whether it solve by hand of IT manager or IT technician ( I suggest to solve by us). </p>
        <p> Problem Solver could be a useful thing because it can save our time a lot. For example, in a device the problem could be very simple and solve in less than 5 minutes but if we don’t know the exact problem of the device, the troubleshooting of it can take as much time as possible even if we couldn’t find the problem, the device don’t use from IT stuff.</p>
        <p> When Problem solver invent successfully, I am sure the companies like (Cisco, Microsoft, TP Link, Multi-Link…) show their interest to Problem Solver.  Just the need from the company that would be interest on it, is to add a specific port for Problem Solver’ chip so it can do its work. By using Problem solver from big and famous companies, the value and cost of their device can go up and also most of the people’s problem will solve. I hope one day a thing like Problem Solver come out.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="newST">
        <h3> Tools and Technologies </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="newC">
        <p> For inventing a Problem Solver, we need to make a chip like a flash. In side of the chip should be a memory storage for the commands to store there. Another thing should be a sensor with update technologies and with a high speed to help the first step of solving which is diagnoses the health of internal pieces. I don’t know what should be but Problem Solver needs an equipment that transfer the packets and the new commands that are run to device for solving the wrong configurations which were ran wrong and created the problem. The final thing is a display page like an iPad that the massages which are coming from the chip, display on it.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="newST">
        <h3> Skills Required</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="newC">
        <p> For implementing our project, we need to be a professional programmer to know programming languages like Python, CSS, HTML, C++ for writing the commands in depth. If we make a Problem Solver for Cisco company, we need be a professional person whose know Cisco courses from CCNA to CCIE in Wireless, Routing, Switching, Security, Collaboration sections and knows all configuration and troubleshooting commands to run them on the chip by using program languages (Python). Also we need a make a wireless connection between our chip and display page which we should know about wireless technology too. If we don’t have these capabilities, we can take help from those who have.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="newST">
        <h3> Outcome </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="newC">
        <p>If the project run successfully, the outcome can be positive. The main positive point is saving time from IT employees. As I wrote before the main problem for a IT Manager or technician can be very simple but sometimes they can’t find that simple problem and it cause to waste lots of time by searching on it but if we have a Problem Solver, we can find and solve the problem in less than 1 minute.</p>
